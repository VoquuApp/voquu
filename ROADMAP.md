# 📍 VOQUU Roadmap

This is an outline of our intended development path. It is intentionally high-level, as the project is still early in development.

---

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundation & MVP
- Establish open-source repository and project structure
- Develop a visual communication prototype using no-code tools
- Design and test core UI components and categories
- Collaborate with caregivers for feedback

### 🔹 Phase 2: Evaluation & Refinement
- Collect insights from early users
- Iterate on structure and visual design
- Improve offline usability and device responsiveness

### 🔹 Phase 3: Localization & Adaptability
- Add multilingual support and community-contributed language packs
- Begin research and testing for alternative access methods (e.g. touchless)

### 🔹 Phase 4: Open Growth
- Expand contributions from global volunteers
- Document internal logic and translation model
- Prepare for integration with learning systems

We are building slowly, intentionally, and with care.  
This is not just a tool — it’s a shared effort to give voice where there was none.
