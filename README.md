# VOQUU — Open AAC for Every Child

**VOQUU** is an open-source Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tool designed for children who are nonverbal, minimally verbal, or have speech difficulties.

We believe everyone deserves a voice — especially those who struggle to be heard.

---

### 🌍 What VOQUU Does
- Simple, symbol-based communication system
- Tap-to-speak voice output
- Customizable visual boards
- Works offline, no ads, no tracking
- Early support for multiple languages

---

### 💡 Why Open Source?
AAC tools are often behind paywalls or lack local language support. VOQUU is free to use, adapt, and extend — forever.

> *"This is why open source matters — it reaches where the market doesn’t."*
